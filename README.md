# Python Template

> A REST python template aimed for bigger applications using FastAPI and pydantic.

During my last interviewing process at the beginning of 2022, I found that setting up an environment from scratch takes longer than I expected,
 and that finding documentation that wasn’t aimed for beginners or small projects takes even longer.
For that reason I created this python template that has helped me speed the development setup using `FastAPI` and `pydantic`.
